my project introduction

This project is designed for the users to facilitate 
This project is designed for the users to facilitate them to search the availability of products in the 
difficult times of the pandemic. They can basically know if the product  is available or not in their 
area without having to go  and search in the different shops. This application is especially very
 beneficial for the old aged users  or the ones who don't know to write or search because they can simply
 click  picture and search for the product availability. This is perfect for people of all the age groups
The name of my application is 'Local Product Finding App' in which users can find a product's 
availability in their locality and it will also provide information about in which shop people can get 
the product. There are alot of features included in my app . It will make it easy for people to find 
availability of the product just by sitting at their own homes.
